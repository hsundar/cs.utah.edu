In this paper, we present a new out-of-core sort algorithm, designed for
problems that are too large to fit into the aggregate RAM available on modern
supercomputers. We analyze the performance including the cost of IO and
demonstrate the fastest reported throughput using the canonical sortBenchmark
on a general-purpose, production HPC resource running Lustre. By clever use of
available storage and a formulation of asynchronous data transfer mechanisms,
we are able to almost completely hide the computation (sorting) behind the IO
latency. This latency hiding enables us to achieve comparable execution times,
including the additional temporary IO required, between a large sort problem
(5TB) run as a single, in-RAM sort and our out-of-core approach using 1/10th
the amount of RAM. In our largest run, sorting 100TB of records using
1792-hosts, we achieved an end-to-end throughput of 1.24TB/min using our
general-purpose sorter, improving on the current Daytona record holder by 65%.
