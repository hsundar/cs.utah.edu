We target high-performance implementations for the solution of hyperbolic PDEs on Stampede using a high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization. One key challenge in achieving high throughput for these applications is that these are heavily memory-bound; additionally the flop/mop ratio changes with the polynomial order of the elemental basis. The other challenge arises from the asymmetry between the CPU and the co-processor making load-balance difficult. We consider parallelization strategies addressing these challenges.
