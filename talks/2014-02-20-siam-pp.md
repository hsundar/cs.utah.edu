Modern supercomputers are increasingly requiring the presence of accelerators
and co-processors. However, it has not been easy to achieve good performance on
such heterogeneous clusters. The key challenge has been to ensure good load
balance and that neither the CPU nor the accelerator is left idle. Traditional
approaches have offloaded entire computations to the accelerator, resulting in
an idle CPU, or have opted for task-level parallelism requiring large data
transfers between the CPU and the accelerator. True work-parallelism has been
hard as the Accelerators cannot directly communicate with other CPUs (besides
the host) and Accelerators. In this work, we present a new nested partition
scheme to overcome this problem. By partitioning the work assignment on a given
node asymmetrically into boundary and interior work, and assigning the interior
to the accelerator, we are able to achieve excellent efficiency while ensure
proper utilization of both the CPU and Accelerator resources.
