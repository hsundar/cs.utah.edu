<h4>Research</h4>
The central focus of my research is the development of computationally optimal <em>parallel, high-performance algorithms</em>, both discrete and continuous, that are efficient and scalable on state-of-the-art architectures. It is driven by applications in <em>biosciences</em> and <em>geophysics</em>, such as cardiovascular mechanics, medical image analysis, and seismic wave propagation. My research has resulted in the development of state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for <a href="research/octrees.html">adaptive mesh refinement</a>, <a href="research/multigrid.html">geometric multigrid</a>, <a href="research/fgt.html">fast Gauss transform</a> and <a href="research/sorting.html">sorting</a>.<br>
